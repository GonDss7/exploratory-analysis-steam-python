# 🎮 Exploratory Data Analysis: Steam Games (Python)

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of best-selling video games on Steam using Python.

## 📌 Dataset
- Cleaned version of Steam games (Excel format)
- Includes variables such as price, rating, downloads, genres, and more.

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Insights
- No strong correlation between price, downloads, and rating
- FPS games dominate in both downloads and estimated revenue
- Popularity ≠ quality: many downloaded games have low ratings

## 📁 Files
- `videojuegos_limpio_gonza.xlsx`: cleaned dataset
- `Analisis_juegos_de_steam.ipynb`: full notebook

## 📌 Conclusions

### 📉 1. Weak correlation between key metrics  
The analysis revealed no strong linear relationship between price, user rating, and estimated downloads. This suggests that a game's price is not a reliable predictor of its popularity or perceived quality.

### 🎮 2. Popularity does not always reflect quality  
Several highly downloaded games received only average or even low user ratings, indicating that high exposure or marketing may drive downloads independently of game quality.

### 🔫 3. FPS games lead in both downloads and revenue  
First-Person Shooter (FPS) titles emerged as dominant in both estimated downloads and total revenue. Their wide appeal and monetization models make them the most commercially successful genre in the dataset.

### 🧩 4. High-rated genres are often niche  
Genres with the highest average ratings tend to attract smaller, more targeted audiences. While not as widely played, they demonstrate strong user satisfaction and potential value in niche markets.

### 💰 5. Revenue is driven more by volume than price  
Games with lower price points but large player bases often outperform expensive games in revenue generation. This highlights the importance of scale in digital distribution platforms.

### 📊 6. Distribution patterns are heavily skewed  
The data exhibits a classic long-tail distribution: the majority of games have low downloads and revenue, while a small number of titles dominate in performance.
